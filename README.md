# meditation_app

## Description

An application that helps the user to monitor their breathing. A circle is used that grows and shrinks in size which helps the user to visualize their breathing. Keyframes are used to animate a pointer that floats around the timing circle to highlight where the user should be focusing their attention on. SetTimeout and SetInterval are used in the JavaScript to add and remove classes at certain points and to keep the animation playing infintely.
